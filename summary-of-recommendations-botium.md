# Security Audit – Summary of Recommendations

## Controls
The audit identified several missing or insufficient security controls, including:
- **Least Privilege**: No formal policy limiting access to only necessary resources.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: No documented or tested plan in place.
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical processes are not divided among multiple personnel to reduce risk.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Absent, leaving potential threats undetected.
- **Backups**: No confirmed backup strategy or regular testing of backup integrity.
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data, including payment card information, is not encrypted at rest or in transit.
- **Password Management System**: No centralized, secure method for password creation, storage, and rotation.

**Recommendation:** Implement these controls immediately to close vulnerabilities and mitigate risks from potential threats.

## Compliance
Compliance gaps were identified that could impact both the organization’s bottom line and brand reputation:
- **PCI DSS**: Inadequate security for credit card data, including lack of encryption and secure access controls.
- **GDPR**: Gaps in securing, classifying, and inventorying customer data.
- **SOC (System and Organization Controls)**: Absence of documented user access policies and insufficient protection of sensitive data.

**Recommendation:** Address compliance deficiencies by enforcing encryption, establishing access control policies, and improving data governance to meet regulatory standards.

## Recommendations Summary
To reduce risk to assets and improve Botium Toys’ security posture, the following actions are recommended in priority order:

1. **Implement a Least Privilege Policy** – Restrict user access to only what is necessary for their roles.  
2. **Deploy a Password Management System** – Enforce strong, unique passwords and automate rotation.  
3. **Enable Data Encryption** – Encrypt sensitive information both at rest and in transit.  
4. **Establish Backup Systems** – Regularly back up data and test restore processes.  
5. **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** – Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and suspicious activity.  
6. **Develop and Test a Disaster Recovery Plan** – Ensure business continuity in the event of a major incident.  
7. **Enforce Separation of Duties** – Distribute critical tasks among multiple roles to minimize risk.  
8. **Conduct Regular Compliance Audits** – Review PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC requirements periodically.

## Additional Considerations
- Conduct regular **security awareness training** for all staff to reduce human error and susceptibility to social engineering.  
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** across all critical systems.  
- Maintain an **incident response plan** that is tested annually.
