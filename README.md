# Cybersecurity Labs & Projects

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects, lab exercises, and practical write-ups designed to showcase technical skills and demonstrate real-world security practices.  
Each project follows a structured format to highlight tools used, methodology, findings, and recommendations.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Document completed labs and projects for portfolio and skill demonstration.
- Provide clear, professional reports that simulate real-world security work.
- Track personal learning progress through applied cybersecurity exercises.

## Structure
Projects in this repository are organized into folders by category or type:

- **Audits/** – Security audit reports, compliance assessments, and recommendations.
- **Incident Response/** – Simulated breach investigations and containment procedures.
- **Pentesting/** – Ethical hacking, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation exercises.
- **Defensive Security/** – Log analysis, SIEM activities, and threat detection.
- **Tools & Scripts/** – Custom scripts and configurations created during projects.

Each folder contains:
- A project-specific `README.md` with an overview.
- Supporting documentation, such as `.md` reports, screenshots, or logs.

## Report Format
All projects follow a standardized reporting format:
1. **Project Name**
2. **Objective**
3. **Tools Used**
4. **Process / Steps Taken**
5. **Findings**
6. **Recommendations**
7. **Key Takeaways**
